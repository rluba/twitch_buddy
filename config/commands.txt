!project,!about,!topic      Extending the CodeView parser (written in Jai) to compare the output of Jai’s x64 and LLVM backends. Hopefully this will allow us to fix a few CodeView bugs.
# I’m learning Google Apps Script / Google Forms / Google Sheets like it’s the 90s! The goal is to help Fabman customers build their own member self-sign-up forms, even if they can’t program.

!jai                        Jai is a new programming language developed by @j_blow. It is designed to be a better alternative to C++ for making games, but it’s also a great systems programming language. There are a series of talks/demos about the language here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO 
!fabman                     https://fabman.io is a company Raphael co-founded. It helps people who run a Makerspace, Fab Lab, or university lab to control access to their equipment, keep track of who has used which machine, etc.

!compiler_todo              At least the following things still need to get done before we can release Jai to a wider audience: 1) Improve context interoperability when Jai programs load static/dynamic Jai libraries. There might be more things…
!keyboard                   Yes, Raphael has a keyboard.
