jai.*open(\s*|-)source	        Currently, Jai is not open-source.
(self[-\s*]?host|bootstrap)     Jai is not self-hosted. It might be in the future, but it’s very low-priority.
lov(e(ly)?|ing).+bot            I love you too!
Mr_Sharkbuddy.*(best|great)     Thanks for recognizing!
(light|dark|white)\s*(theme|mode|background)     Yes, Raphael has functioning eyes and a properly lit environment. So he can tolerate both dark and light themes. You should try it sometimes.
vim|theme|editor\b|dotfile        Raphael is using VimR (NeoVim) with the gruvbox theme. If you care about those things, you can find his (messy) neovim config at https://github.com/rluba/neovim-config
speckflunder                    Raphael’s current MacBook Pro is named Speckflunder because it is thicker than the MBP it replaced, which was named Flunder (because it was very thin).
